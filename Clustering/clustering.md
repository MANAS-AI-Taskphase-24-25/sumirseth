# Clustering
How is clustering done in machine learning?

1. Define Similarity (choose a distance metric)
2. Choose number of clusters
3. Initialize clusters randomly
4. Iterate:  
    - Assing each data point to the closest cluster
    - Update cluster centroids
    - Repeat until stabalizes

### Common Algorithms
1. K-Means
2. Hierarchical Clustering
3. DBSCAN

> Note: Clustering algorithms aim to minimize the distance between points within the same cluster (intra-cluster distance) while maximizing the distance between points in different clusters (inter-cluster distance).
